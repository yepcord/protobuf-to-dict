# protobuf-to-dict

protobuf-to-dict is a small Python library for creating dicts from protocol
buffers. It is intended to be used as an intermediate step before
serialization (e.g. to JSON).

# Installation

Note: This is a fork. Install by pointing to this github repo.

For example:

`pip install git@github.com:yepcord/protobuf-to-dict.git`

# Example

Given the `google.protobuf.message.Message` subclass `MyMessage`:

```python
>> > from protobuf3_to_dict import protobuf_to_dict, dict_to_protobuf
>> > my_message = MyMessage()
>> >  # pb_my_message is a protobuf string
>> > my_message.ParseFromString(pb_my_message)
>> > my_message_dict = protobuf_to_dict(my_message)
>> > print(my_message_dict)
{'message': 'Hello'}
>> > msg = dict_to_protobuf(MyMessage, values=my_message_dict)
>> > assert msg == my_message
True
```

# Datetime conversion

This package automatically converts Python's datetime objects to Google's Timestamp and vice-versa.
If you want to manually do the conversion, the functions are:

```py
from protobuf3_to_dict import datetime_to_timestamp, timestamp_to_datetime

timestamp = datetime_to_timestamp(sample_datetime)
result_sample_datetime = timestamp_to_datetime(timestamp)
assert sample_datetime == result_sample_datetime
```

# Getting all fields, field names and options of a protobuf class

For example in the tests folder you can find sample.proto:

```
message Obj {
    int32 id = 1 [(is_optional) = true];
    string item_id = 2;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp transacted_at = 3;
    Status status = 5;
}
```

Then you can:

```py
>> > from protobuf3_to_dict import get_field_names_and_options
>> > for field, field_name, options in get_field_names_and_options(sample_pb2.Obj):
    ...
print('name: {}, options: {}'.format(field_name, options))

name: id, options: {'is_optional': True}
name: item_id, options: {}
name: transacted_at, options: {}
name: status, options: {}
```

# Validation for required fields

Protobuf 3 does not have a notion of required vs. optional fields. Everything is optional. However if you need some sort of validation before converting your dictionary to a protobuf object, first of all you need to add an option to your protobuf messages that is called `is_optional`. Note that this is different than the `optional` keyword in Prorobuf 2. This is an "option":

For example in the tests folder you can find sample.proto:

```
message Obj {
    int32 id = 1 [(is_optional) = true];
    string item_id = 2;
    google.protobuf.Timestamp transacted_at = 3;
    Status status = 5;
}
```

Then you can validate if a dictionary has all the fields you need:

```py
>> > import datetime
>> > from protobuf3_to_dict import validate_dict_for_required_pb_fields
>> >
>> > dic = {'item_id': 2, 'transacted_at': datetime.datetime.now(), 'status': 0}
>> > from tests import sample_pb2
>> > validate_dict_for_required_pb_fields(pb=sample_pb2.Obj, dic=dic)
```

But if you have missing fields:

```py
>>> dic = {'item_id': 2}
>>> validate_dict_for_required_pb_fields(pb=sample_pb2.Obj, dic=dic)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "protobuf-to-dict/protobuf_to_dict/convertor.py", line 274, in validate_dict_for_required_pb_fields
    raise FieldsMissing('Missing fields: {}'.format(', '.join(missing_fields)))
protobuf_to_dict.convertor.FieldsMissing: Missing fields: transacted_at, status
````

## Caveats

This library grew out of the desire to serialize a protobuf-encoded message to
[JSON](http://json.org/). As JSON has no built-in binary type (all strings in
JSON are Unicode strings), any field whose type is
`FieldDescriptor.TYPE_BYTES` is, by default, converted to a base64-encoded
string.

If you want to override this behaviour, you may do so by passing
`protobuf_to_dict` a dictionary of protobuf types to callables via the
`type_callable_map` kwarg:

```python
>> > from copy import copy
>> > from google.protobuf.descriptor import FieldDescriptor
>> > from protobuf3_to_dict import protobuf_to_dict, TYPE_CALLABLE_MAP
>> >
>> > type_callable_map = copy(TYPE_CALLABLE_MAP)
>> >  # convert TYPE_BYTES to a Python bytestring
>> > type_callable_map[FieldDescriptor.TYPE_BYTES] = str
>> >
>> >  # my_message is a google.protobuf.message.Message instance
>> > protobuf_to_dict(my_message, type_callable_map=type_callable_map)
```

By default, the integer representation is used for enum values. To use their
string labels instead, pass `use_enum_labels=True` into `protobuf_to_dict`:

```python
>>> protobuf_to_dict(my_message, use_enum_labels=True)
```

And if you need the enum labels to be automatically converted to lowercase:

```py
>>> protobuf_to_dict(my_message, use_enum_labels=True, lowercase_enum_lables=True)
```

When you convert from dictionary to protobuf, if you need the enums to work both
in lowercase and uppercase, set the `strict=False`.

# Testing

`pytest tests/`

To regenerate `src/tests/sample_pb2.py`:

run the `compile.sh` file inside the tests folder.

# attention
Prorobuf 3.0.0 has supported json now.
